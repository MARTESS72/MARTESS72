 <!👋 Hi, I’m @MARTESS72 and I try to install easyphp dev server on my windows 11 new computer, 
 and I am absolutey lost in here... I had already done it 2 times on previous computer, without any trouble, but this time 
 I can't open the dashboard, I have e message error: 
 Impossible d'executer le code car MSVCR110.dll est introuvable... etc
 And Easy php is nowhere to be found in my installed programs list, I can't even undo what I have done... 
 i don't have a clue about if I am at the right place, I did "support" and followed the instructins. If you can help me, 
 well, I would be very, very happy...>
